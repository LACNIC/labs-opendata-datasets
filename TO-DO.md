# TO-DO List for Opendata-Datasets

## Open already existing db dumps non-destructively

Use already existing dbs without dropping current data. Add a flag

## Add support for RIPE NCC RPKI Validator ROA export

Process the exported CSV and create a dump out of it.

## Multiple tables in a single database file.

This probably works already... if the same db_filename is specified. Maybe just write a simple test for it.
